    <h2 class="first1">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol class="second">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br><br>
        <li><span id="one">Css is not necessary</span> <span id="two">Css saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br><br>
        <li id="basic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="first1">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="heading">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However , <span id="two">in this <br>tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span>
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br>for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p class="second">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also<br>
    special in that you can use a special URL, to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p class="second">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the<br> 
        element. </p>
    <p class="second">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
